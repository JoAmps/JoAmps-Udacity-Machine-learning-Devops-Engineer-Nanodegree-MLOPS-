# Predict Customer Churn

## Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
### Project was on information on customers in a certain bank, with the goal to develop a model to predict teh customers that churned, in order for the bank to be able to put measures in place to keep these and potential customers from churning in the future. This project was already completed in a raw format, so i applied the best practices to improve the code to make it into a production ready code, by refactoring, logging and testing.


## Running Files
### There are two python files, churn_library.py and churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
### The churn_library.py contains the actual code for data ingestion, manipulation,feature engineering training and validation ### The churn_script_logging_and_tests.py contains code to test and log the output.
### data - contains the data used for the analysis and training
### models - contains the two models used for the training, random forest and logistic regression
### images - contains screenshots of several aspects of the project, it was required to pass the project
### logs - contains information of every aspect of the code in order to track what is going on
### To run this file, first run the requirements.txt file to install the libraires by using pip install -r requirements.txt
### Use python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py, and the outputs would be obtained. The output expected should be results of the training of the machine learning models, and all thr graphs, such as age distribution, feature importance and roc curve of the two models
